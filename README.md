# automate_rsync
Configure rsync once, add multiple jobs with simple headings

This script aims to create a simple method for configuring complex rsync jobs and
adding additional jobs easily.

Quick start (tl;dr):

  If no configuration file is found (~/.automate_rsync.rc) the script will walk you
  through the intial configuration.

For more information on configuring SSH, rsync and this script please see instructions.txt
