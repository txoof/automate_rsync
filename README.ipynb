    "Simplify running complex rsync jobs through an .ini file.\n",

    "`automate_rsync` is writen entirely in Python 3 with standard modules and runs as a single executable file and should run in any \\*nix like environment where rsync is available\n",

    "\n",
    "## QUICK START\n",
    "Copy & paste the lines below into the terminal to setup automated, unattended rsync jobs in macOS. If you are at all uneasy about running scripts downloaded and excuted without review, **GOOD FOR YOU!** You can review the scripts by cloning this repo, or downloading [this tar ball](https://github.com/txoof/automate_rsync/raw/master/automate_rsync.tgz).\n",
    "1. Install automate_rsync system wide (only needs to be done once by an admin user\n",
    "    * `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/automate_rsync/master/remote_install/system_install.sh)\"`\n",
    "    * `nano ~/.config/com.txoof.automate_rsync/automate_rsync.ini`\n",
    "3. [Allow `bash` disk access](https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/manually-granting-applications-full-disk-access-macos-catalina/)\n",
    "2. Install a launchd plist to run automate_rysnc to run every 30 minutes (this must be done for every user)\n",
    "    * `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/automate_rsync/master/remote_install/launchd_install.sh)\"`\n",

    "## Use\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Use in macOS\n",
    "automate_rsync can run from a LaunchDaemon in macOS. Begining in Mojave and later, Apple has implemented restrictions on how applications access certain folders within the user directory. This restriction also applies to shell utilities such as bash. \n",
    "\n",
    "When this script is run from the `terminal.app`, those privliges are likely already granted by the user when prompted by the OS on the first use. Launchd runs this script by envoking `bash -c \"/usr/local/bin/automate_rsync.py\"`. As such, `bash` needs to be granted full disk access large parts of the user's home directory. This must be done for every user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide full disk access to the `bash` binary\n",
    "    * See these [instructions (12 March 2020)](https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/manually-granting-applications-full-disk-access-macos-catalina/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and enable `automate_rsync` use the included `install.sh` script and `daemon_install.sh` script, or do the following manually:\n",
    "1. `$ cp automate_rsync.py /usr/local/bin/`\n",
    "    * Provides system wide access to the binary\n",
    "2. `$ cp com.txoof.automatersync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents` \n",
    "    * this must be done for each user\n",
    "    * this is the launch agent file that launchdaemon will use to start the script\n",
    "    * the default schedule to run is every 30 minutes (1800 seconds) see: `<key>StartInterval<key>`\n",
    "4. `$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgets/com.txoof.automatersync.plist`\n",
    "    * Make launchd aware of the plist file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnosing launchd issues\n",
    "Launchd does not offer great debugging tools. Jobs that fail to run will do so very quietly. If you are having trouble with automate_rsync, it is likely due to some problem with the environment under which it runs from launchd. The bash shell that is run by the daemon is an extremely stripped down version without your regular LANG and PATH environment variables. This can cause all sorts of odd behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips for debugging:\n",
    "* Double check that automate_rsync runs on the command line. If it fails under normal circumstances, you've got bigger problems.\n",
    "* Check in the `console.app` and search for 'com.txoof.automatersync' in the system.log section for some hints. \n",
    "    * `abnormal code:` indicates the script terminated with an error:\n",
    "        * 1: general errors - could be just about anything\n",
    "        * 127: command not found - likely means that your python environment is broken\n",
    "    * Change the .plist file to match `<string>export LANG=en_US.UTF-8; /usr/local/bin/automate_rsync.py &gt;&gt; ~/plist.log</string>`\n",
    "        * this will redirect any error output to `~/plist.log` for further review\n",
    "    * Try adding the path to your rsync binary to your `automate_rsync.ini` file. \n",
    "        * use `$ which rsync` to determine the path to your rsync executable\n",
    "        * add that path to your `automate_rsync.ini` file using `rsync_bin = /path/to/your/rsync` under the `[%base_config]` section\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
