    "`automate_rsync` is writen entirely in Python 3 with standard modules and runs as a single executable file and should run in any \\*nix like environment where rsync is available\n",

    "## QUICK START\n",
    "Copy & paste the lines below into the terminal to setup automated, unattended rsync jobs in macOS. If you are at all uneasy about running scripts downloaded and excuted without review, **GOOD FOR YOU!** You can review the scripts by cloning this repo, or downloading [this tar ball](https://github.com/txoof/automate_rsync/raw/master/automate_rsync.tgz).\n",
    "1. Install automate_rsync system wide (only needs to be done once by an admin user\n",
    "    * `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/automate_rsync/master/remote_install/system_install.sh)\"`\n",
    "    * `nano ~/.config/com.txoof.automate_rsync/automate_rsync.ini`\n",
    "3. [Allow `bash` disk access](https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/manually-granting-applications-full-disk-access-macos-catalina/)\n",

    "## Use in macOS\n",
    "automate_rsync can run from a LaunchDaemon in macOS. Begining in Mojave and later, Apple has implemented restrictions on how applications access certain folders within the user directory. This restriction also applies to shell utilities such as bash. \n",
    "\n",
    "When this script is run from the `terminal.app`, those privliges are likely already granted by the user when prompted by the OS on the first use. Launchd runs this script by envoking `bash -c \"/usr/local/bin/automate_rsync.py\"`. As such, `bash` needs to be granted full disk access large parts of the user's home directory. This must be done for every user.\n",

    "* Provide full disk access to the `bash` binary\n",
    "    * See these [instructions (12 March 2020)](https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/manually-granting-applications-full-disk-access-macos-catalina/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and enable `automate_rsync` use the included `install.sh` script and `daemon_install.sh` script, or do the following manually:\n",
    "1. `$ cp automate_rsync.py /usr/local/bin/`\n",
    "    * Provides system wide access to the binary\n",
    "2. `$ cp com.txoof.automatersync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents` \n",
    "    * this must be done for each user\n",
    "    * this is the launch agent file that launchdaemon will use to start the script\n",
    "    * the default schedule to run is every 30 minutes (1800 seconds) see: `<key>StartInterval<key>`\n",
    "4. `$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgets/com.txoof.automatersync.plist`\n",
